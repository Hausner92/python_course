# Hello, Python 🐍!

*Because Pathon is used in automated tests, I made the decision to learn it. <br>
The course, which is offered on the Udemy website, covers all the fundamentals of Pathon. <br>
Created by [Paweł Krakowiak](https://e-smartdata.org/).*

*If you want, here you can see my progress with Pathon.* 🎓

*The code created during the video lesson is in the "01_intro.py" file. <br>
The practice exercises code can be found in the "exercises.py" file.*
