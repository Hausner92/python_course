# Hello, Python 🐍!

*Because Pathon is used in automated tests, I made the decision to learn it. <br>
The course, which is offered on the Udemy website, covers all the fundamentals of Pathon. <br>
Created by [Paweł Krakowiak](https://e-smartdata.org/)*

*The code created for the video lesson is located in the "01_intro.py" file. <br>
The practice exercises code can be found in the "exercises.py" file.*
